# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to manage my repositories on GitHub as well as how to remotely push to them from the terminal so I don't need to open a browser if I so choose. 'git remote' Is a usefull command that I think I'll be typing a lot in the future. I also added another repository on my account with a basic website I worked on over the weekend that contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game!.

### Day 2: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got three books in from amazon today. Two from Jon Duckett: HTML&CSS and JavaScript&Jquery. Also got a book from Mark Myers, A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript. Spent about a half hour skimming those books at first before diving back into my Tic Tac Toe site. Made some progress on that with some new logic added and the discovery of a very small bug I can tackle tomorrow.

### Day 3: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just like I posted on my Twitter, I finally started freecodecamps course today and made a fair bit of progress
on the front end sectionn. Learned a little more about the '<img>' tag then I knew in the past, figured out a fair bit about the '<form>' tag
as well as buttons and input types that can go into a form. I sadly didn't make much progress on my Tic Tac Toe site yet but maybe later tonight
I can come back and tackle that bug I noticed in my site.

### Day 4: March 26, 2018

**Disclaimer**: Alright I missed quite a few days I can be honest. Got distracted hanging out with friends over the weekend and played too much league but I'll get back into the swing of things now! In fact I might even use this catch up time to learn how to write a twitter bot or something to just pull a tl;dr off this log for me... or so I can dream.

**Today's Progress though**: Starting to get a little more comfortable in VIM. That counts as coding right? I'm writing my own maps and slowly building a .vimrc file for myself. Oh and I started another simple website. This one's a little more simple than Tic Tac Toe though. It's merely going to be a static site full of my book marks that I can keep online between laptops. The catch is that I'm hopefully going to implement more CSS and get more comfortable with it!

### Day 5: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a little progress on my bookmark site. Really just added an index and minor updates to the stylesheet. Nothing impressive. The only impressive thing is that everything was updated using VIM today! Really got lost in the weeds with VIM and mappings and buffers. All that jazz. I actually pushed my vimrc onto a repository in case I ever switch laptops.

### Day 6: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So I am really bad at logging things on a daily basis. That is something I really need to work on. Now aside from that little hiccup I have been working on code related things. I've been slowly updating my bookmarks page still as well as learning about Ruby and Jekyll. I plan on putting a little more effort into learning Ruby for scripting and in the event I learn Ruby on Rails; however I did use Jekyll to make a small page to upload using GitHub pages. Throughout the week I plan on adjusting it more visually to suit me better but at least for now I can say it's live.

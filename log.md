# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to manage my repositories on GitHub as well as how to remotely push to them from the terminal so I don't need to open a browser if I so choose. 'git remote' Is a usefull command that I think I'll be typing a lot in the future. I also added another repository on my account with a basic website I worked on over the weekend that contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game!.

### Day 2: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got three books in from amazon today. Two from Jon Duckett: HTML&CSS and JavaScript&Jquery. Also got a book from Mark Myers, A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript. Spent about a half hour skimming those books at first before diving back into my Tic Tac Toe site. Made some progress on that with some new logic added and the discovery of a very small bug I can tackle tomorrow.

### Day 3: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just like I posted on my Twitter, I finally started freecodecamps course today and made a fair bit of progress
on the front end sectionn. Learned a little more about the '<img>' tag then I knew in the past, figured out a fair bit about the '<form>' tag
as well as buttons and input types that can go into a form. I sadly didn't make much progress on my Tic Tac Toe site yet but maybe later tonight
I can come back and tackle that bug I noticed in my site.

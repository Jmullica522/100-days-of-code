# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to manage my repositories on GitHub as well as how to remotely push to them from the terminal so I don't need to open a browser if I so choose. 'git remote' Is a usefull command that I think I'll be typing a lot in the future. I also added another repository on my account with a basic website I worked on over the weekend that contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game!.
